		<strong>16. Failures and System Outage; Temporary Time-Out for Pending Auctions</strong></li><li>

16.1  The highest priority to  Coincod is to provide an exciting, successful and reliable auction service, through its Coincod auction website, to the Participants.</li><li>
16.2  With the state of art in software and hardware technology as available today, it is not possible to develop and operate computer programmes, computer hardware, mobile phones, and other data processing systems and units with zero failure guarantee, nor to exclude unpredictable errors or malfunctions in connection with the use of the internet as a data transmission medium (together referred to as "IT System Failures"); also other external factors beyond the control of  Coincod, such as natural disasters and power outages (together "Other External Factors"), can disrupt the  Coincod auctions.</li><li>
16.3  Based on this,  Coincod cannot represent that its auction website and its other information technology systems, as involved in the operation of the  Coincod auctions, are available at all times without any interruptions or technical failures whatsoever. As a consequence,  Coincod assumes no liability for any damage whatsoever to Participants or any third parties resulting from IT System Failures or Other External Factors.</li><li>
16.4  The  Coincod auction system may occasionally experience a temporary and unscheduled downtime in a data processing or data transmission system (hardware or software), as a result of which Bids (for one or several single auctions) cannot be properly submitted by Participants and/ or properly received and processed by  Coincod (hereinafter "System Outage").</li><li>
16.5  A system outage has occurred if no bids can be submitted for items due to an unforeseeable disruption in a system. In such a case, auctions will be temporarily halted and the remaining times for the auctions, the current bidding price and the current highest bidder will be maintained. After the disruption has been resolved, the auctions will be continued. Temporarily halted auctions are clearly indicated. Bids placed on a temporarily halted auction shall not be credited back on a Participant\'s account and are not eligible for a refund for bids used or other costs incurred.</li><li>
16.6  Coincod shall not be liable for any damage whatsoever incurred by auction Participants or third parties from using Coincod\'s service. In particular, Coincod shall not be liable for damage that occurs due to bids submitted by auction Participants not being received by  Coincod or not being received promptly or not being considered, as a consequence of technical faults.
